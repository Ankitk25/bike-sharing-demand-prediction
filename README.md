Bike Sharing Demand Prediction

  This project aims to address the challenge of predicting the hourly demand for rental bikes in urban cities to improve mobility convenience.
  Rental bike services play a crucial role in reducing urban congestion and enhancing public transportation systems. Ensuring that bikes are 
  available at the right time and location is essential for customer satisfaction and operational efficiency.

Key Highlights:
  Problem Statement:
  
    The objective is to forecast the number of bikes required at specific hours of the day to maintain a stable supply, 
    reduce waiting times, and support efficient urban transportation systems.

  Dataset:

    Includes historical data on rental bike usage.
    Features such as weather conditions, time of day, season, and holiday indicators are utilized.
    Data pre-processing techniques are applied to handle missing values, outliers, and feature scaling.
    
  Analysis and Insights:

    Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify usage patterns across different times, seasons, and conditions.
    Visualization of trends like peak demand hours, weather impact, and seasonal variations.
    
  Model Implementation:

    Regression models are developed to predict hourly bike demand.
    Techniques include linear regression, decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting algorithms.
    Hyperparameter tuning is performed to improve model accuracy and performance.
    
  Evaluation:

    Models are evaluated using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R-squared.
    Comparison of models to identify the best-performing approach.
    
  Impact:

    The predictions assist service providers in ensuring adequate bike availability, improving user experience, and reducing operational inefficiencies.
    Contributes to the broader goal of sustainable urban mobility.
